# Website development for web designer

See some pages here (<a href="https://valeravilks.github.io/site-for-web-designer/dist/index.html" target="_blank">click</a>)

This site was developed for a web designer. The main task of the site is to demonstrate the work of the designer, as well as indicate information about his services and prices.

The site was created using CMS Wordpress, with a convenient administrative panel for editing information on the site.

The main difficulty of this project was the implementation of the main screen. On it is a complex element that synchronously flips to change the image. It required a lot of work and javascript knowledge.
